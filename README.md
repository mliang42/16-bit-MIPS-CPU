A 16-bit MIPS cpu with a five stage pipelin that was built using Logisim. 

Refer to http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html to download Logisim.

If you're running this and bugs start popping up, especially blue wires, then restart Logisim.

To see how the 16-bit instructions are encoded, refer to the pictures.
